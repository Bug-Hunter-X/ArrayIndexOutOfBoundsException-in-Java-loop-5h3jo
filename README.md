This repository demonstrates a common Java error: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The `bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.java` provides the corrected version.  The error arises from an off-by-one error in the loop condition when iterating over an array.  This example highlights the importance of careful array indexing in Java to avoid runtime exceptions.
